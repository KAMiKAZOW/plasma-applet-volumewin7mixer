[b]v11 - July 7 2016[/b]

* This requires KDE 5.7+
* Bump version ahead of the AUR package which bumped versions before I started versioning.
* Merged from upstream (plasma-pa):
  * Use the default speaker volume in the panel icon.
  * Media keys only control the default speaker.
  * Volume Boost to 150%. Can be toggled per app by clicking the speaker icon (formerly the mute button). I will be moving that button to a context menu as soon as I figure out how. Example: https://streamable.com/oqt4
  * Don't disable the slider when muted, alowing the user to change the volume without unmuting.
  * Handle Microphone shortcuts.

[b]v2 - May 13 2016[/b]

* Supports KDE 5.5 and KDE 5.6 (Maybe 5.4?)
* Custom vertical volume slider.
* Configurable number of steps to reach 100% volume with media keys.
* Add links to alsamixer and pavucontrol in context menu.
* Merged from upstram (plasma-pa):
  * Drag and drop to move app output to a specific speaker.
