This optional plugin is not ready yet. **Do not package it.**

The widget will work fine without the plugin, but if installed, will show the current sound level in the slider similar to Windows 7. Currently only shows the effect for "sinks" (aka the speakers).

Run `sh ./install` to install dependencies and compile this optional plugin. Ideally, the config window will detect if the plugin is installed and disable unavailable settings. I plan having a button that will launch the install script to make it easier for users who install via the store.
